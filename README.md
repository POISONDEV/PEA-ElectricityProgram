## üîß Technical Details

### Voltage Classifications
- **High Voltage**: ‚â•69 kV, ‚â•66 kV, ‚â•60 kV
- **Medium Voltage**: 22-33 kV
- **Low Voltage**: <22 kV

### Rate Components
1. **Base Electricity Charge**
   - Service fees
   - Energy charges
   - Demand charges (where applicable)

2. **Fuel Tariff (Ft)**
   - Variable rate: 0.3672 baht/kWh (default)
   - Year-specific adjustments

3. **Value Added Tax (VAT)**
   - 7% on total base cost + Ft

### Calculation Formula
```
Total Bill = (Base Cost + Ft Cost) + VAT
VAT = (Base Cost + Ft Cost) √ó 0.07
```
